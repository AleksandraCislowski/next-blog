## Fort São Sebastião

The Fort São Sebastião of Castro Marim is located in the village, parish and municipality of Castro Marim, in the District of Faro.
Its importance stems from it being the best preserved example of the extensive process of renovation of the town's defensive system in the mid-17th century.
The fort has been classified as a National Monument since 2012.
